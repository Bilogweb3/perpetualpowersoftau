**Entropy sources:** My entropy cocktail recipe: took random words and numbers from people, has them, and concat put random symbols in between.

**Time taken:** ~ 20 hours

**Side channel defenses:** Running in isolation area (on dacha). Closed all the applications, services, and daemons on the laptop and switched off the connection to the internet.

**Postprocessing:**

- Rebooted the laptop, then transferred the files to an external hard drive, plugged that into a different laptop, and uploaded them to the remote server.
